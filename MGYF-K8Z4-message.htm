    Because the above credentials expire, they should not be used for any persistent services or scheduled tasks to run as.  If you need a service account for these tasks or services, and the customer is not yet live, please contact the Cloud Services Project Manager.  If the customer is live then contact css@trimble.com to get a service account setup.  Please do not reply to this email as replies will go nowhere.<br>
